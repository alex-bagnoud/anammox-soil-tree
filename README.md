# anammox-soil-tree

This github repository details the phylogenetic analyses carried out in the paper **Environmental factors determining distribution and activity of anammox bacteria in minerotrophic fen soils** written by Alexandre Bagnoud, Sylvia Guye-Humbert, Brigitte Schloter-Hai, Michael Schloter and Jakob Zopfi and published in *Insert journal name here + link*.

Two phylogenetic analyses are reported here. The first one concerns only [anammox sequences retrieved from this study](phylogenetic-analysis-of-anammox-sequences-retrieved-from-this-study). As it was performed in 2008, a combination of cloning and Sanger sequencing were used, and not so many sequences were obtained. The second analysis is similar, but uses as input all anammox sequences retrieved from public database and that originate from terrestrial environments. 

Note: the statistical analyses of this article are presented in another [repository](https://github.com/alex-bagnoud/AnammoxBellefontaine).
